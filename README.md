# Hangman Game (Python) 🎮

My first Python project created during my first month of learning programming (**February 2026**).

## 📝 Description
A classic Hangman game where the player tries to guess a hidden word letter by letter. 

## 🚀 Features
- Random word selection.
- ASCII art visuals for the hanging man.
- Input validation (checks for repeated or invalid characters).
- Final win/loss result display.

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script: `python main.py`

## 👨‍💻 Learning Progress
This project helped me understand:
- Python Loops and Conditionals.
- String manipulation and Lists.
- Importing modules like `random` and `string`.
